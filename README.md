## Projects

### Deep Metric Learning Baselines
Implementations of various Deep Metric Learning standards in a fashion that allows for easy extension and inclusion of novel methods. Provides standard architectures (ResNet50, GoogLeNet) with respective evaluation protocols, triplet sampling methods and loss functions. See (https://confusezius.github.io/Deep-Metric-Learning-Baselines) for more info.

### Liver Lesion Segmentation for LiTS using 2D UNets
This repo is build around a variable UNet scaffold for different 2D architectures. Training can be performed using a multitude of loss functions (dice loss, pixel- or class-weighted cross-entropy loss, combined loss-functions, jaccard loss...). See (https://confusezius.github.io/unet-lits-2d-pipeline) for more info.
